## 🚀 How to Run

4. I have created an automaton script for a Login and a Logout
5. Run the test from `Runner.java` or using a Cucumber feature file

## Note
1. Username and password on the Guru99 demo site change every 20 days.
2. This framework automatically fetches the latest credentials directly from the webpage before logging in.
3. No manual update of credentials is needed.
4. So you always use the current valid credentials during test execution.
